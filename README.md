# Make a cup of coffee
Are you getting used to drinking coffee every day? If yes, so this is important to learn how to make good coffee at home step by step!

Good coffee in the morning can change everything and no matter if you had a nightmare last night or you had a magic dream.
Now, let's learn how to make the perfect cup of coffee in your kitchen for starting an awesome day.

You can make a good coffee at home in 2 ways:

|  Use a Filter Coffee Maker  |  Use a Moka Pot |
|  -------------------------- | --------------- |

Let's see how to make your morning coffee in each way:

## 1- Make coffee with a Filter Coffee Maker
For making coffe with a Filter Coffee Maker, you need a high quality coffee maker. 
If you want to buy a good filter coffee maker, ### see ['Delonghi Filter coffee makers'](https://www.delonghi.com/en-gb/products/coffee/filter-coffee-makers/c/filter_coffee_makers)

#### Now let's start to make a cup of coffee step by step:
1- Grind coffee to a medium-fine particle size.

2- Place coffee filter in filter basket. All auto drip coffee makers have a filter basket that is usually right under the brew head (where the hot water comes out).

3- Add one tablespoon of coffee to a paper filter for every cup (6 oz) of coffee you want to make. If you want more full-bodied, richer coffee, use a permanent filter. 

4- Add cold, filtered water to the reservoir. Use 6 ounces of water for every cup of coffee you want to make. 

5- Press the start button to begin the coffee maker’s brew cycle. Most auto drip coffee makers will have a simple “start” button or switch.

Your morning coffee is ready. Enjoy it. :coffee::yum:

## 2- Make coffee with a Moka Pot
Making coffee in this method creates a thick, strong coffee, with water pushed up through the coffee grounds as it boils, extracting as it goes. For making coffee in this way, you need a good Moka Pot.

If you want to buy a Moka Pot, ### see ['Best Moka Pot'](https://www.shopcoffee.co.uk/shop/brewing-equipment/moka-pot)

#### Now let's start to make a cup of cooffee step by step:
1- No need to boil the kettle. Just fill the bottom of the Moka Pot with water up to the valve.

2- Add your coffee to the filter basket and level it off, add the filter to the base of the Moka Pot and then screw the top of the pot back on. You can brew coffee using a Moka Pot without filter papers; the paper removes some sediment.

3- Add heat! The Moka Pot can be placed directly onto a gas or electric hob. Wait for the water to boil and then lower the heat slightly to produce a constant simmer. This will cause the water to rise through the coffee and up the spout, spilling the coffee into the top part of the Moka Pot.

4- Once the pot starts to hiss, the coffee is ready and should be served immediately! Water this one down if needs be – it’s strong!

Your morning coffee is ready. Enjoy it. :coffee::yum:
