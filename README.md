# Make a cup of coffee
Are you getting used to drinking coffee every day? If yes, so this is important to learn how to make good coffee at home step by step!

Good coffee in the morning can change everything and no matter if you had a nightmare last night or you had a magic dream.
Now, let's learn how to make the perfect cup of coffee in your kitchen for starting an awesome day.

You can make a good coffee at home in 2 ways:

1- Use a Filter Coffee Maker

2- Use a Moka Pot

Let's see how to make your morning coffee in each way:

## 1- Make coffee with a Filter Coffee Maker
For making coffe with a Filter Coffee Maker, you need a high quality coffee maker. 
If you want to buy a good filter coffee maker, see ['Delonghi Filter coffee makers'](https://www.delonghi.com/en-gb/products/coffee/filter-coffee-makers/c/filter_coffee_makers)

1- Grind coffee to a medium-fine particle size.

2- Place coffee filter in filter basket. All auto drip coffee makers have a filter basket that is usually right under the brew head (where the hot water comes out).

3- Add one tablespoon of coffee to a paper filter for every cup (6 oz) of coffee you want to make. If you want more full-bodied, richer coffee, use a permanent filter. 

4- Add cold, filtered water to the reservoir. Use 6 ounces of water for every cup of coffee you want to make. 

5- Press the start button to begin the coffee maker’s brew cycle. Most auto drip coffee makers will have a simple “start” button or switch.

Your morning coffee is ready. Enjoy it.
